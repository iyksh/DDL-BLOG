# Discovery Data Lab Blog

Discovery Data Lab Blog is a Django-based web application. 

## Setup
***Warning: This setup example has GNU/LINUX commands, if needed change the commands for your Operating System.***

1. Clone the repository *(make sure that you have git, obviously)*

When running the shell, it should automatically install all libraries by *pip*, make sure you have *pip* installed on your operating system, (if it doesn't install all the libraries needed to run, let me know which libraries are missing)
